# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [v3.3.1] - 2026-06-29

### Features

- Add experimental **Web Session Cookie Login** support for push notifications. Allows logging in via session cookies to securely bypass OAuth restrictions and receive notifications via the custom backend.

## [v3.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Features

- Add a **Theme Builder** in **Settings > Appearance > Themes** to create, save, and manage multiple custom themes that behave like Apollo's built-in themes, including importing and exporting themes to share them (#454: @jordanearle, @icpryde)
- Add **AI Summaries** in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Apollo AI** (off by default, iOS 26+) — generates post, discussion, and linked-article summaries entirely **on-device** using Apple's FoundationModels (#489, #491: @jordanearle, @icpryde)
  - Post summaries appear in the comments header between the title and body, and discussion summaries appear above the first comment on larger threads; summaries stream in token-by-token and are cached to disk so reopening a thread is instant
  - Includes per-type controls and a **Tap to Summarize** option that avoids auto-fetching a linked article's page until you ask for it
- New experimental **API-Key-Free Mode** in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > API Keys** to use Apollo without API keys by signing in to reddit.com directly! Supports browsing, voting, commenting, and saving. (#442: @nickclyde)
  - In this mode, images attached to comments and posts now upload straight to Reddit's own CDN instead of falling back to Imgur (#495: @nickclyde)
- Add **multi-account credentials** so each signed-in account can use its own Reddit API key (or web session) instead of sharing one, with a redesigned account switcher to add, edit, reorder, and remove accounts, and support for Reddit "Web app" confidential clients (#505: @DeltAndy123)
- Add **Picture-in-Picture** for videos and GIFs — a floating in-app miniplayer that keeps playing as you scroll through the comments (drag to reposition, swipe to hide, double-tap to resize), with optional handoff to the iOS system PiP so playback continues when you leave Apollo (#467: @JeffreyCA)
- Add **Img Chest** as a media upload host in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media Upload Host** for single images and albums, with thumbnails and host labels in **Manage Uploads**, the ability to delete Img Chest uploads, and an improved album viewer with share, Save All, an accurate loading percentage, and swipe-to-dismiss (#434: @icpryde)
- Revamp the **Subreddit Sidebar** to render new-Reddit's structured content above the existing markdown — community stats (subscribers and created date), a **Search by Flair** chip row that jumps straight to a flair's posts, related communities, resource links, and a table of contents (#462: @icpryde)
- Add an opt-in **Community Highlights** carousel in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Subreddits**, showing a subreddit's pinned posts as tappable cards at the top of the feed, with tap-to-collapse, spoiler blurring, and an optional **Load All Highlights** mode that surfaces the full set of pinned posts (#463, #499: @icpryde)
- Expand **Filters & Blocks** with per-subreddit keyword and post-flair filters plus subreddit-name filtering that hides any subreddit whose name contains a word (e.g. `circlejerk`) across feeds and search (#507: @icpryde)
- Improve **Direct Chat** with inline images, GIFs, and emoji/snoomoji in message bubbles, ImgChest-backed image sending, a recipient avatar in the composer, a **Direct Chat** inbox filter with avatars on every row, and an **Inline Media in Chat** toggle in **Settings > Media** (#488: @icpryde)
- Add **Apple's on-device Translation** (iOS 18+) as a translation provider in **Settings > Translation > Primary Provider**, alongside Google and LibreTranslate (#460: @icpryde)
- Show a user's **Social Links** on their profile page (#465, #496, #498: @icpryde)
- Move **Rich Link Previews** into its own settings section with a combined Body, Comments, and Color sub-screen, and replace the preset card colors with a full color picker (grid, spectrum, sliders, eyedropper, hex) plus quick swatches, a live card preview, and exact full-fill card coloring with automatic text contrast (#504: @icpryde)
- Add **Include Link** and **Share as Video** options to **Share as Image** — attach the post's Reddit link alongside the rendered image, or export the post as a video (#484: @icpryde)
- Add **Inbox Comment Scroll** so tapping a reply in the Inbox lands on the linked comment instead of the top of the post (#457: @icpryde)
- Improve the **user flair selector** to handle old (CSS-class) and emoji-based flair systems, add a custom-emoji picker, and show clearer empty states instead of errors or walls of blank rows (#474: @icpryde)
- Show **moderator avatars** in the subreddit Mods list (#459: @icpryde)
- Add **0.75× and 1.25× playback speeds** to the fullscreen video player (#476: @icpryde)
- Add a **hold-for-2× gesture** — press and hold the right side of a fullscreen video to play at 2× while held, then release to restore the previous speed (#479: @icpryde)

### Fixes

- Replace the misleading **"Error Loading Notifications — contact developer"** alert on free-Apple-ID sideloads with a clear **Notifications Unavailable** explanation, since Apple only grants the push entitlement to paid Developer accounts, so push, watchers, and inbox alerts can never reach those builds; paid-account sideloads and App Store/jailbreak builds are detected and left untouched (#492: @federgilad)
- Make **deleted comment recovery** faster and more reliable, with cleaner labels on recovered comments and a heads-up when enabling it that comments may load slower (#418: @nunoo)
- Fix the tweak's settings screens only following the system light/dark mode instead of **Apollo's own color theme**, along with related cell coloring glitches when switching appearance (#440: @iCrazeiOS)
- Keep a profile's **avatar, banner, bio, and social links** visible even when **Show User Profile Pictures** is turned off (#487: @icpryde)
- Rework the **feed and subreddit search bar** so the navigation bar fully hides on iOS 26 instead of floating half-visible, and add an opt-in **Keep Search Bar In Place** mode in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > General** (#451: @icpryde)
- Fix **link-preview card text** showing raw HTML entities like `&amp;` (#461: @icpryde)
- Fix the **SUBREDDIT SUGGESTIONS** header overlapping the first row on the Search tab (#478: @icpryde)
- Fix the **modern subreddit list** tinting the whole navigation bar when the Home row is selected (#453: @icpryde)
- Fix the **profile-picture tab icon** greying out after opening a direct chat room from the Inbox (#458: @icpryde)
- Fix the **translation globe** spacing in the Liquid Glass navigation bar (#455: @icpryde)
- Fix **Pixel Pals** opening their menu over media, web views, and modals (#506: @icpryde)
- Hide the redundant **GIF** caption beneath inline GIFs (#464: @icpryde)
- Improve the **manual sign-in fallback** UI on older iOS versions (#480: @Alstruit)
- Fix **Hide Mod Subreddits** stripping the moderator badge and mod tools when every moderated subreddit was hidden; the Subreddits list now filters display only, leaving the app-wide moderator roster intact (#500: @icpryde)
- Restore the **follow-thread Live Activity** in the Reborn widgets so a self-hosted notification backend can render and update it again (#490: @nickclyde)
- Show the **website name** on a link card when the scraped title is only numbers, instead of a bare number like a single-page app's match ID (#503: @icpryde)

## [v3.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Features

- New **Apollo Reborn Widgets** — nine Home Screen, Lock Screen, and StandBy widgets (Showerthoughts, Jokes, Post, Feed, Photo, Shortcuts, Apollo Actions, Calendar, and Headline) (#406: @jordanearle)
  - Most widgets read Reddit through your API key: copy a one-time setup code from **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Copy Widget Setup Code** and paste it into any widget, and the rest pick it up automatically
  - Tapping a widget opens the post or subreddit in Apollo; included in the standard build but not the no-extensions variant
- Add a **Universal OAuth Sign-In** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn** (on by default) to fall back to Apollo's native sign-in if the in-app login causes trouble, and ship released IPAs with the `dystopia` and `redreader` sign-in URL schemes already registered so the shared API key works without manually editing Info.plist (#432: @JeffreyCA)
- Add a **manual sign-in fallback** for older iOS versions that can't load Reddit's login page, using an external browser and an Apollo Reborn userscript to paste a sign-in code back into Apollo (#430: @DeltAndy123; sign-in keyboard improvements by @Alstruit)
- Add a **Text Post Thumbnails** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn > Media** (on by default) — text posts that embed an image now show a thumbnail with a **Text Post** badge, and tapping it opens the image in the media viewer instead of the thread (#426: @icpryde)
- Add **Hide Mod Subreddits** to remove moderated subreddits you can't leave from the Subreddits list — tap Edit, then the blue button to hide a subreddit and the green button to bring it back (#424: @icpryde)
- Show **moderator reports** as native inline sections in the post and comment action menu (#412: @JeffreyCA)
- Make the **banned-profile overlay** dismissable (#409: @JeffreyCA)
- Combine cache-clearing options into one **Clear Tweak Caches** button under a renamed **Data** section (#409: @JeffreyCA)

### Fixes

- Show the **author avatar and subreddit icon** in **Share as Image** post exports, so the image matches what you see in the app (#438: @icpryde)
- Fix several **link card glitches in feeds** — cards whose text overflowed into the post below, Bluesky posts losing their paragraph breaks, compact cards stuck at full height, and blank image areas on links whose thumbnail isn't ready yet (#427: @icpryde)
- Fix **gallery GIFs** getting stuck on a loading spinner when swiping between items in an album (#404: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix comment and post text showing a literal **`&#x200B;`** or an extra blank line at the end (#405: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **comment scrolling freezing** in threads that contain a link to removed media, such as a deleted `v.redd.it` video (#395: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix spurious **"error :(" overlay** appearing over videos that play fine but whose preview image fails to load (#409: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Live Activities** not updating on secret-protected self-hosted notification backends (#411: @nickclyde)
- Fix an **installation conflict** when upgrading from some older versions (#401: @Alstruit)
- Bundle **libFLEX inside the app** so rootless jailbreak users can keep the standalone libFLEX package installed without it conflicting with Apollo Reborn (#437: @iCrazeiOS)

## [v3.1.1] - 2026-06-07

- Fix a **crash when sharing a post to Messages or Mail** from the share sheet — the system compose controller was misidentified as an Apollo composer, leaving GIF-toolbar injection timers that dereferenced the dismissed share UI and crashed (#378: @nickclyde)
- Fix **Reddit login on iOS 15** by automatically falling back to Old Reddit, and add an Old Reddit button to the auth view for users who need to switch manually (#377: @DeltAndy123)
- Fix **video controls** overlay rendering, including the AirPlay button getting clipped or misaligned (#383: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **flair alignment** so post and user flairs no longer sit too low or clip their text (#389: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Color Flairs** reverting to grey or the wrong shade after returning to Apollo from the background (#391: @icpryde)

## [v3.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Features

- Support **any custom redirect URI** for the Reddit API without patching the app's Info.plist, so custom URI schemes authenticate without the "address is invalid" error (also removes the need for LiveContainer users to patch manually) (#368: @DeltAndy123)
- Add **GLASS Icons** and **No Extensions + GLASS Icons** distribution variants that bundle the Liquid Glass icon catalog without opting into the iOS 26 UI runtime (#317: @nackerr)
- Add new **Glitched** (@bajader) and **Modern** / **Modern Alt** (@paulo1manso) Liquid Glass app icons (#353: @bajader, @paulo1manso)
- **Restore logged-in accounts** when restoring a settings backup, so reinstalling no longer requires re-authenticating each Reddit account (#331: @nickclyde)
- Add a **Subreddit List Enhancements** toggle in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > Subreddits** to fall back to Apollo's native list, working around misaligned rows and a broken index scrubber on some devices (#355: @JeffreyCA)
- Add a **Color Flairs** option in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > General** to color post and user flairs using Reddit's flair colors (#360: @icpryde)
- Add **Show Deleted Comments** to restore deleted or removed comments inline from archived copies when available (#300: @nunoo)
- Render comments with **two or more link previews** as compact cards instead of stacking full hero cards (#344: @icpryde)
- Show **feed thumbnails for text posts** that embed images but produce no native thumbnail, in both Large and Compact modes (#351: @icpryde)
- Fade and disable the comment **image/GIF buttons** when a subreddit doesn't allow that media type, instead of failing only at submit time (#356: @icpryde)
- Add a separate **Autoplay Inline GIFs** setting in **Settings > Apollo Reborn Options > Media** to control inline GIF autoplay independently of Apollo's native Autoplay GIFs/Videos setting (#365: @JeffreyCA)
- Ship an Apollo-Reborn **userscript** and an **"Open in Apollo" Shortcut** recipe as app-independent ways to open Reddit links in Apollo from any browser, handy for the no-extensions variant (#307: @nickclyde)

### Fixes

- Fix the bundled **"Open in Apollo" Safari extension**, which stopped opening links on sideloaded builds — its default "Automatic" mode redirected through `openinapollo.com`, whose auto-open only works for the App Store build. It now redirects straight to `apollo://` and handles `/s/` share links (#307: @nickclyde)
- Fix the bundled **"Open in Apollo" share-sheet action** so it opens Reddit links in Apollo from **any** browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave…), not just Safari, replacing a deprecated call that iOS 18+ refused to run. On iOS 26 the extension only launches if your installer sets the appex main-binary flag — **AltStore/SideStore** do, **Sideloadly/Feather** don't, where the Shortcut remains a signer-independent fallback (#307: @nickclyde)
- Fix **Recently Read** showing no posts after a Reddit API change (#341: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix inline **Reddit GIFs in comments** staying frozen instead of autoplaying until collapsed/expanded or refreshed (#349: @icpryde)
- Fix inline **GIFs not autoplaying on cellular** when Autoplay GIFs/Videos is set to Always (#347: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix the inline **video play button** missing on post-body Reddit videos and a clipped AirPlay icon (#350: @icpryde)
- Fix laggy **subreddit header** scrolling and incorrect handling on non-subreddit feeds (#339: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix **Share as Image** not opening under the iOS 26 native action menu (#335: @icpryde)
- Fix the **Rich Link Previews – Body** setting having no effect and following the Comments setting instead (#329: @nickclyde)
- Fix a crash in the banned-profile hook (#326: @JeffreyCA)
- Fix a crash when navigating into comments from a dangling host pointer in inline image cleanup (#362: @JeffreyCA)

## [v3.0.0] - 2026-05-29

### Features

- Post **GIFs in comments**: a new **Gif** button in the compose toolbar opens a built-in Giphy browser (trending + search) and uploads selected GIFs natively to Reddit (#276: @icpryde)
    - Requires a free Giphy API key — set it in **Settings > Custom API > API Keys > Giphy API Key**. See the in-app **Giphy & ImgChest API Key Setup** guide for instructions (#285: @icpryde)
    - Inline playback honors **Settings > General > Autoplay GIFs/Videos** with a static cover + play overlay when paused
- Add **Image Chest** inline album support: bare Image Chest links show the first image inline and open an in-app album viewer with tap-to-hide controls, idle auto-hide, and per-image pinch zoom (#241: @icpryde)
    - To set up Image Chest, create an account at https://imgchest.com, generate an API token at https://imgchest.com/profile/api, and paste it into **Img Chest API Key** under **Settings > Custom API > API Keys**

- Long-press peek now works on usernames and subreddit links in threads and comments (#262: @icpryde)
- Show **banned profile state** with a dead Snoo overlay on user profiles, and surface comment author hints for banned/suspended users (#271, #278: @icpryde, @jordanearle)
- Add **editable user flair text** support to Apollo's flair selector (#255: @nunoo)
- Rich link previews now support translation alongside the rest of post and comment content (#262: @icpryde)
- Subreddit list (Modern mode) polish (#262: @icpryde)
- Add **41 new Liquid Glass icon variants** by @jryng under a new **New Variants** group, plus new **Aperture Science** and **ApollOS** icon sets by @bajader, and reorganize the in-app App Icon picker into groups to reduce clutter (#287, #254: @DeltAndy123, @jryng, @bajader)
- Add **Inline Media Alignment** option in **Settings > Custom API > Media** to left-align, center, or right-align inline images that don't fill the full content width (#273: @lampemw)
- Rename **Custom API** to **Apollo Reborn Options** in Settings, polish the **Thanks To** screen with maintainer/code/icon & design groupings sourced from `contributors.json`, and add an **Apollo Reborn Subreddit** row that opens r/ApolloReborn in-app (#294: @icpryde)
- **Mask API keys** in Custom API settings: Reddit, Reddit Secret, Imgur, Img Chest, and Giphy fields show dots when idle and reveal only while editing (#276: @icpryde)
- Add **Buy Us a Coffee** screen in Settings with maintainer links, and move Apollo's original **Tip Jar** to **Settings > About** above **What's New** (#294: @icpryde)

- Smoother scrolling through threads with lots of rich link previews (#262: @icpryde)
- Keep user profile cards and peek previews up to date when an account is suspended or banned (#278: @jordanearle, @icpryde)

- Fix crash on Reddit link previews in some comment threads (#276, #280: @JeffreyCA, @icpryde)
- Fix Reddit-hosted GIFs stopping animation after leaving and returning to a thread (#276: @icpryde)
- Fix Giphy GIFs posted from Apollo not rendering in the official Reddit iOS app (and showing a "image was probably deleted" placeholder when editing in Apollo) (#289: @icpryde)
- Fix Compact link preview cards growing to hero size and overlapping the next comment after voting on a comment that contains a link (#290: @icpryde)

## [v2.14.0] - 2026-05-20

### Features

- **Notification Backend** support (requires paid Apple Developer account): point Apollo at your own forked self-hosted [apollo-backend](https://github.com/nickclyde/apollo-backend) instance so push registrations, watchers, and inbox checks route there instead of being silently dropped. (Thanks @nickclyde!)
    - Configure in **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend** with the backend URL and optional registration token. Leave empty to keep current blocking behavior.
    - APNs delivery still requires a paid Apple Developer account on the signing side. 
- New **Reddit API Secret** field in **Settings > Custom API > API Keys** so per-account Reddit credentials can be forwarded to a self-hosted notification backend that performs token refreshes server-side. Usually left empty for installed-app Reddit credentials. (Thanks @nickclyde!)

### Fixes

- Improve **Profile Picture Tab Icon** reliability across Liquid Glass tab bar refreshes, theme changes, and app foregrounding.
- Refine Liquid Glass **Hide Bars on Scroll** idle behavior with smoother re-collapse/re-expand handling and disable the idle setting on unsupported iOS versions.
- Improve performance and stability across subreddit list polish, rich link previews, and the media post composer.

## [v2.13.0] - 2026-05-19

- Add single-video Reddit-hosted uploads from the media composer, including video selection, poster upload, and native hosted-video posts (thanks @icpryde!)

- Add **harunatsu** Liquid Glass app icon to Apollo's native App Icon picker (thanks @jordanearle and /u/harunatsu91202024!)
- Liquid Glass: new **Tab Bar Re-Expands When Idle** toggle in **Settings > Custom API > General** that re-expands the tab bar after a deliberate upward scroll or a longer idle timeout (thanks @icpryde!)
- New **Thanks To** screen under **About** section. Thank you to all the contributors who've helped make this tweak what it is ❤️

### Fixes

- Fix Reddit-hosted multi-image photo posts by submitting them as native Reddit galleries instead of Imgur albums, including the post-submit comments permalink Apollo opens after success (thanks @icpryde!)
- Fix the Photo Post composer thumbnail strip so all selected images can be reviewed with reliable horizontal scrolling before submit (thanks @icpryde!)
- Improve user avatar loading on multireddits

## [v2.11.0] - 2026-05-15

## [v2.0.0] - 2025-03-07

🎉 ***Massive*** update that enables Ultra features like saved categories, new app icons and Pixel Pals! This also brings new features like recently read posts and fixes for some longstanding Apollo bugs.

The Custom API settings view has also been redesigned and is now accessible directly from Settings.

**Note:** Ultra features that rely on push notifications do not work out of the box. Advanced users can optionally point the tweak at a self-hosted [apollo-backend](https://github.com/nickclyde/apollo-backend) fork (see **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend**) — APNs delivery requires a paid Apple Developer account on the signing side.

### Saved Categories
- To enable saved categories, set "Allow Saved Categories" in Settings > General > Other

    - **Always**: Header videos are always automatically unmuted after opening comments 
- New "Preferred GIF Fallback Format" setting (Settings > General > Custom API)
    - Choose between GIF or MP4 when Apollo fetches certain animated images from Reddit API

- Fix certain Streamable links not loading in media view

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-01-10

- Support custom redirect URI and user agent (in Settings > General > Custom API)
- Liquid Glass: fix sort options alignment in comment view

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-01-07

- Fix crashes in Custom API settings on older iOS versions

    - Restore long press gesture on account tab to open account switcher

    - Fix misaligned tab labels on startup

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-12-28

- Backup and restore most Apollo and tweak settings (in Settings > General > Custom API)
    - Settings are exported as a .zip file with 2 plist files: preferences.plist (most Apollo and tweak settings) and group.plist (filters, theme settings)
    - Restoring settings **does not** restore or affect existing account logins. This means on a clean install, accounts need to be re-added manually. The backup .zip contains an accounts.txt with all account usernames for reference.
- Update Custom API Settings layout

## [v1.2.6] - 2025-11-08

- Fix video downloads failing on certain v.redd.it videos
    - Recently, Reddit started using [CMAF media format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/about-the-common-media-application-format-with-http-live-streaming-hls) for serving video content, which Apollo does not natively support downloading for.

## [v1.2.5] - 2025-10-18

- Fix occassional crashes when scrolling on iOS 26 with Liquid Glass patch (thanks @dankrichtofen for the original implementation)
- Fix crashes when tapping share URL link buttons on iOS 26
    - Note that this is **not** a full fix. Tapping the link button now navigates to a webview on iOS 26. As a workaround, tap the inline text (see [comment here](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/62#issuecomment-3247359652)).

## [v1.2.2] - 2025-01-16

- Fix video downloads failing on certain v.redd.it videos
    - Note that the `.deb` file is significantly larger (several MB) because of new external dependencies needed to fix the issue (FFmpegKit)

## [v1.2.1] - 2024-12-19

- Custom random and trending subreddits - you can now specify an external URL to use as the source for random and trending subreddits (in Settings > General > Custom API)
    - Sources should be a plaintext file with one subreddit name per line, without the `/r/` prefix (see examples below)
    - Default trending source (data from [gummysearch.com](https://gummysearch.com/tools/top-subreddits/)): https://jeffreyca.github.io/subreddits/trending-gummy-daily.txt
    - Default /r/random source: https://jeffreyca.github.io/subreddits/popular.txt
    - New setting to customize how many trending subreddits to show

## [v1.1.7] - 2024-10-19

## [v1.1.6] - 2024-10-05

- Fix crashing issue when loading content

## [v1.1.3] - 2024-08-23

Fix issue with newer Imgur images and albums not loading properly

## [v1.1.2] - 2024-08-01

Update user agent to fix multireddit search

## [v1.1.1] - 2024-07-27

- Working hybrid implementation of "New Comments Highlighter" Ultra feature
- Add FLEX integration for debugging/tweaking purposes (requires app restart after enabling in Settings -> General -> Custom API)

## [v1.0.12] - 2024-07-25

Use generic user agent independent of bundle ID when sending requests to Reddit

## [v1.0.11] - 2024-02-27

Fix issue with Imgur uploads consistently failing. Note that multi-image uploads may still fail on the first attempt.

## [v1.0.10] - 2024-01-22

Add support for /u/ share links (e.g. `reddit.com/u/username/s/xxxxxx`).

## [v1.0.9] - 2023-12-29

- Randomize "trending subreddits list" so it doesn't show **iOS**, **Clock**, **Time**, **IfYouDontMind** all the time - thanks [@iCrazeiOS](https://github.com/iCrazeiOS)!
    - Context: There isn't an official Reddit API to get the currently trending subreddits. Apollo has a hardcoded mapping of dates to trending subreddits in this file called `trending-subreddits.plist` that is bundled inside the .ipa. The last date entry is `2023-9-9`, which is why Apollo has been falling back to the default **iOS**, **Clock**, **Time**, **IfYouDontMind** subreddits lately.

## [v1.0.8] - 2023-12-15

- Lower minimum iOS version requirement to 14.0
- Toggleable settings for blocking announcements and some Ultra settings (not fully working, see [#1](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/issues/1)). **These are the same as the previous experimental builds.**
    - All toggles are located in Settings -> General -> Custom API
    - New Comments Highlightifier shows new comment count badge, but doesn't highlight comments inside a thread
    - Subreddit Weather and Time widget doesn't seem to work (not showing or loads infinitely)

## [v1.0.7] - 2023-12-07

- Add support for resolving Reddit media share links ([#9](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/pull/9)) - thanks [@mmshivesh](https://github.com/mmshivesh)!

## [v1.0.5] - 2023-12-02

- Fix crash when tapping on spoiler tag

## [v1.0.4] - 2023-11-29

Add support for share links (e.g. `reddit.com/r/subreddit/s/xxxxxx`) in Apollo. These links are obfuscated and require loading them in the background to resolve them to the standard Reddit link format that can be understood by 3rd party apps.

The tweak uses the workaround and further optimizes it by pre-resolving and caching share links in the background for a smoother user experience. You may still see the occassional (brief) loading alert when tapping a share link while it resolves in the background.

There are currently a few limitations:
- Share links in private messages still open in the in-app browser
- Long-tapping share links still pop open a browser page

## [v1.0.3b] - 2023-11-26
- Treat `x.com` links as Twitter links so they can be opened in Twitter app
- Fix issue with `apollogur.download` network requests not getting blocked properly (#3)

## [v1.0.2c] - 2023-11-08
- Fix Imgur multi-image uploads (first attempt usually fails but subsequent retries should succeed)

## [v1.0.1] - 2023-10-18
- Suppress wallpaper popup entirely

## [v1.0.0] - 2023-10-13
- Initial release
